# LearningGBsize

This is code used for "Predicting the cardinality of a reduced Gröbner basis" [link coming as soon as preprint available] by Shahrzad Jamsidi, Eric Kang, and Sonja Petrović. 

The Jupyter notebooks [Vectors.ipynb](Vectors.ipynb) and [Features.ipynb](Features.ipynb) contain the code for learning and prediction described in the paper. 

The data files for 250,000 ideals are in the text files; the full data sets as described in the paper will be available shortly.
